			<p class="flavor">"Keep an eye on halfpaw, Eida."<br/>
				Farin said softly, looking at the lean Ahkin that accompanied them. it hadn't taken long for Farin to notice that whenever there was a fight their Ahkin friend would scurry off into the tall underbrush to hide. but her ability to lead them safely through the grey wilds had more than made up for her cowardice.<br/>
				-Farin Margon.<br/>
				To deaths court.</p>
			<p>Ahkin are a hearty people, surviving under circumstances that would crush a less resilient people. They live in the highest of mountains, the deepest of caves, and among the great flatlands.</p>
			<h4>Small and light</h4>
			<p>With their small size and slender frame, Ahkin appear almost sickly to most humans and to members of many other races. ranging in size from 3 to 5 feet tall at their tallest, many Ahkin could be confused for a child by members of other races.</p>
			<h4>Quick lived</h4>
			<p>Ahkin live short lives, living to just over 30 years. giving them a drive to do and see that other longer lived races do not. They reach maturity at the age of 4, giving them ample time to find what they want out of life.</p>
			<p class="indent">They find that the tendency of longer lived races to settle down in one spot for years at a time boring and a waste of time. Ahkin are doers, and you will often find them busy traveling or trading or whatever else strikes their fancy. if they are going to do it they do it well until it no longer holds their interest.</p>
			<h4>Curious by nature</h4>
			<p>Ahkin are an inquisitive folk. When they are not tending to their young or hunting for food they can be found tinkering with small objects and jewelry, tending to injured wildlife, or observing their surroundings.</p>
			<p class="indent">They find anything and everything a font of interesting observations and ideas, and are happy to share it with anyone who listens. Because of their inquisitive nature and tendency to take things apart to figure out how they work, it is not suprising that many Ahkin become wizards or artificers. indeed it is more surprising that more do not.</p>
